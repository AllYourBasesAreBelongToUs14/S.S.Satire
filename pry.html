<h1>Pranoy Admits to Being a Narcissist</h1>
<p>Written by David Wang and Ben Li at 10:30 Tuesday, April 11th</p>
<p>This past Friday, after a long time of proding and poking, Pranoy Dutva has finally admitted to being a narcissist! It started off as a normal lunch, with Pranoy spouting out phrases about his perfectly chiseled face and how he was so smart. After a while, however, he finally announced, "I'm so handsome, it's no suprise that I'm narcissistic. If you had my face you would too!" gaping, the people near him quickly took out their phones and asked him to repeat himself. Within seconds, the aspiring Inidan programmer was across the internet, saying how he was a narcissist. Many people are not suprised, however, and only shrugged saying that it was about time he finally admit it.  </p>
